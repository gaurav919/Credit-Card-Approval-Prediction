# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
At present, with the development of machine learning algorithms. 
More predictive methods such as Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines have been introduced into credit card scoring. 
However, these methods often do not have good transparency. It may be difficult to provide customers and regulators with a reason for rejection or acceptance.

Task
Build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client, different from other tasks, the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given. 
You should use some techique, such as vintage analysis to construct you label. Also, unbalance data problem is a big problem in this task.
